## Abstract

Let _X_ be projective smooth variety over an algebraically closed field _k_ and let _ℰ_, _ℱ_ be _μ_\-semistable locally free sheaves on X. When the base field is _ℂ_, using transcendental methods, one can prove that the tensor product _ℰ_ ⊗ _ℱ_ is always a _μ_\-semistable sheaf. However, this theorem is no longer true over positive characteristic; for an analogous theorem one needs the hypothesis of strong _μ_\-semistability; nevertheless, this hypothesis is not a necessary condition. The objective of this paper is to construct, without the strongly _μ_\-semistability hypothesis, a family of locally free sheaves with _μ_\-stable tensor product.

## 1\. Introduction

When the base field is _ℂ_, the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence ensures that a vector bundle on a complex projective variety is polystable if and only if it admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric with respect to the Kähler metric induced by _𝒪__X_(1) (see \[[1](#bib-0001)\] for curves and \[[2](#bib-0002)\] for complex compact varieties). In this way, one can prove that the tensor product of Hermitian-Einstein bundles is again Hermitian-Einstein, therefore polystable, and the same is true for symmetric and exterior products. However, in positive characteristic, this is false; in \[[3](#bib-0003)\], Gieseker proved the existence of stable vector bundles on curves with nonsemistable symmetric products. When these bundles are of degree zero, the nonsemistability of the symmetric product imply the nonsemistability of the tensor product. One way to solve this problem is to introduce the concept of strong _μ_\-semistability. Let _F_ : _X_ → _X_ be a total Frobenius morphism of _X_; we say that _ℰ_ is strongly _μ_\-semistable if for all _m_ ≥ 0 the pullback (_F__m_) \*_ℰ_ is _μ_\-semistable with respect to the induced polarization (_F__m_) \*_𝒪__X_(1). Under these assumptions, the tensor product of strongly _μ_\-semistable bundles is again strongly _μ_\-semistable (see \[[4](#bib-0004), Section 7\] for curves and \[[5](#bib-0005)\] for general case). However, in general, there are no conditions to ensure the _μ_\-semistability of a tensor product of _μ_\-semistable bundles (at least not known to the author).

The aim of this work is the construction of examples, in any characteristic, of families of _μ_\-stable bundles with _μ_\-stable tensor products, this without the assumption of strong _μ_\-stability. The key result is Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), which shows that, if _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ is étale and Galois with g.c.d.(|_G_ | , char(_k_)) = 1, then _ℱ_ is _μ_\-semistable (_μ_\-polystable) if and only if _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-semistable (_μ_\-polystable, resp.). We remark that, in positive characteristic, this result is false for an arbitrary finite morphism. Under these hypotheses, if _ℒ_ is a line bundle on _Y_, in Corollary [3.2](#mthst-0005 "Link to mathStatement") we show that _ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-(semi)polystable if _ℱ_ is _μ_\-(semi)stable. If in addition g.c.d.(deg  _ℱ_, _r__k_(_ℱ_)) = 1 = (|_G_ | , _r__k_(_ℱ_)) and _g_\*_ℒ_ ≠ _ℒ_ for all _g_ ∈ _G_, then in Corollary [3.5](#mthst-0011 "Link to mathStatement") it is proved that _ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-stable. The other examples that are constructed come from the _G_\-invariant decomposition of _π_\*_𝒪__Y_. Now, the general outline of this construction is as follows. In Section [1](#sec-0001), we observe that _π_\*_𝒪__Y_ has a natural _G_\-invariant decomposition:

where _ℐ_ is the set of irreducible representations of _G_ over _k_ and each _ℰ__V_ is a locally free sheaf of rank dim  _V_. Also, we have the relations

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/cf6cf464-eef4-4eb4-bebf-825f925b5d21/isr3659672-math-0002.png)(1.2)

where ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/f7fc6b32-13fa-4ec4-96df-a541e2965fe8/isr3659672-math-0003.png) and ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/59e122db-4036-47fb-9da4-cb0cee7a78c2/isr3659672-math-0004.png). In Section [2](#sec-0003), we show that _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable for any polarization on _X_ and also that _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable (_μ_\-_H_\-semistable) whenever _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable (_μ_\-_H_\-semistable, resp.). Furthermore, let _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_) be the moduli space parametrizing _μ_\-_H_\-stable sheaves of rank _r_ and degree _d_, if g.c.d.(_d_, _r_) = 1 = g.c.d.(|_G_ | , _r_), we proved in Theorem [3.12](#mthst-0024 "Link to mathStatement") that, for any irreducible representation _V_ of _G_ and _ℱ_ ∈ _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_), _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable and the natural morphism _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_) → _ℳ__X_(_r_ · dim _V_, _d_ · dim _V_) given by _ℱ_ ↦ _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ is injective.

In Section [3](#sec-0004), we proved that, if g.c.d.(_d_, |_G_|) = 1, then, for all _r_ > 0, _G_ acts without fixed points on _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_); in particular the morphisms _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_) → _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_)/_G_ are étale Galois covers, thus we have nontrivial examples for Section [2](#sec-0003). Finally, when _X_ is an abelian variety and _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ is an isogeny of degree _r_, Proposition [4.5](#mthst-0032 "Link to mathStatement") shows that, if g.c.d(_r_, _d_) = 1, then each irreducible component of Pic_d_(_Y_)/_G_ is an irreducible component of _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_), where _G_ = Ker (_π_). Section [5](#sec-0006) is devoted to prove Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement").

### 1.1. Notations and Conventions

Throughout the paper, _k_ denotes an algebraically closed field and _G_ a finite group satisfying that g.c.d.(|_G_ | , char(_k_)) = 1. Also, _X_ denotes a smooth projective variety over _k_ with a fixed polarization, that is, with a fixed ample line bundle _𝒪__X_(1), and we denote by _H_ any divisor in the linear system |_𝒪__X_(1)|.

We denote by _k_\[_G_\] the group algebra of _G_ with coefficients in _k_. Also, if _T_1 and _T_2 are representations of _G_ over _k_ then we denote by 〈_T_1, _T_2〉 the dim Hom_k_(_T_1, _T_2) _G_ = dim  Hom_k_\[_G_\](_T_1, _T_2). We will identify vector bundles on _X_ with locally free _𝒪__X_\-modules.

## 2\. Étale Covers

Let _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ be an étale Galois cover. Now, we recall that a locally free sheaf _ℱ_ on _Y_ is a _G_\-sheaf (see \[[6](#bib-0006), page 69\]) if _G_ acts on _ℱ_ in a way compatible with the action on _Y_. Since _π_ is étale, it is flat; hence, we have that _π_\*_ℱ_ is a locally free _𝒪__X_\-module with an action of _G_. From this, we have defined a natural morphism of _k_\-algebras ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/431fba92-d651-4e65-bf7c-a15c4cb880d6/isr3659672-math-0005.png). Now, as we suppose by hypothesis that g.c.d.(char(_k_), |_G_|) = 1, Maschke′s Theorem guarantees that _k_\[_G_\] is a semisimple _k_\-algebra of finite dimension |_G_| over _k_. We denote by _ℐ_ = {_V_0, …, _V__r_} the set of irreducible representations of _G_ over _k_, that is, the set of irreducible _k_\[_G_\]-modules, and by {_e__V_} _V_∈_ℐ_ the set of corresponding idempotents. Thus, we have that

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/6e838c50-1f12-4420-8ca5-fd0961c0a0d2/isr3659672-math-0006.png)(2.1)

On the other hand, by Theorem 1(B) in \[[6](#bib-0006), page 111\], there is a locally free sheaf _ℋ_ on _X_ such that _ℱ_≃_π_\*_ℋ_, so we have natural _G_\-invariant isomorphisms _π_\*_ℱ_≃_π_\*_π_\*_ℋ_≃_ℋ_ ⊗ _π_\*_𝒪__Y_≃⨁_V_∈_ℐ__ℋ_ ⊗ _e__V_(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_); therefore, to understand the _G_\-structure of _π_\*_ℱ_ it suffices to do it for _π_\*_𝒪__Y_. Thus, we have the next.

Proposition 2.1. Let _X_ be a smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field _k_ and _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ and étale Galois cover with Galois group _G_. Let _V_ ∈ _ℐ_ and define _ℰ__V_ as the _𝒪__X_\-module _π_\*(_V_\*⊗_k__𝒪__Y_) _G_ = _e__U_(_π_\*(_V_\*⊗_k__𝒪__Y_)), where _V_\* is the dual representation of _V_ and _U_ is the trivial representation.

    where _ℐ_ is the set of all irreducible representations of _G_ over _k_ and _r__a__n__k_ _ℰ__V_ = dim_k__V_. Also, one has that _ℰ__V_ = _e__U_(_V_\* ⊗ _e__V_(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_)) and ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/e9ce24d6-71cb-447a-b112-7f452f006651/isr3659672-math-0008.png),

    where ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/beedce69-a321-46d6-b9e3-474d027e81ed/isr3659672-math-0014.png).
    

Proof. We recall that _k_\[_G_\]≃⨁_V_∈_ℐ__V_⊗_k__V_\* as _k_\[_G_ × _G_\]-modules, where actions are given by ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/1ece6c16-2f40-4631-9479-2157c02cc6b0/isr3659672-math-0015.png) and _g_1 × _g_2(∑_v_ ⊗ _δ_) = ∑_g_1(_v_) ⊗ _g_2(_δ_), respectively. Thus, we have the following _G_\-invariant isomorphisms:

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/54d7fc08-69e2-4f4e-9b9f-0b81ddfbbc40/isr3659672-math-0016.png)(2.5)

Now, Theorem 1 in \[[6](#bib-0006), page 111\] asserts that _π_\* defines an equivalence between the category of locally free _𝒪__X_\-modules of finite rank and the category of locally free _𝒪__Y_\-modules of finite rank with _G_\-action. This proves that _π_\*_𝒪__Y_≃⨁_V_∈_ℐ__V_⊗_k__ℰ__V_. In particular, we have that _ℰ__V_ = _e__U_(_V_\* ⊗ _e__V_(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_)), where _U_ is the trivial _k_\[_G_\]-module.

On the other hand, at the generic point _ϵ_ of _X_, ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/6ed5fd89-19d6-49bd-ad96-43c146896997/isr3659672-math-0017.png) is the function field _K__Y_ of _Y_ which, by the normal basis theorem, is isomorphic to _K__X_\[_G_\] as _K__X_\[_G_\]-modules, where _K__X_ is the function field of _X_. Thus, we have a natural _K__X_\[_G_\]-isomorphisms:

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/2a9829e1-4220-4c28-9d12-aff7a6cb3e92/isr3659672-math-0018.png)(2.6)

and we conclude that _ℰ__V_ is a locally free sheaf with rank (dim  _V_).

For the last part of (1), we need to see that ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/975c689a-63a2-4915-a3dc-1effbf77f663/isr3659672-math-0019.png), but this is a consequence that the trace morphism ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/b13e40e2-45f8-4b16-b356-9dd8d7e76a9f/isr3659672-math-0020.png) is a _G_\-invariant isomorphism.

(2) This is immediate from

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/918abe14-cd67-402f-9f90-3822c7b4c2b6/isr3659672-math-0021.png)(2.7)

(3) We observe that

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/aa1c145f-8e5b-471d-a2d4-b4ce72dc87ab/isr3659672-math-0022.png)(2.8)

and from Schur′s Lemma, dim_k_Hom_k_\[_G_\](_V_, _W_) is 0 if _V_ ≠ _W_ and 1 if _V_≃_W_ (see \[[7](#bib-0007), page 181\]).

(4) We know that tensor functors commutes with the pull back, so we have that

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/bbf5852c-5f82-4f72-83a0-c04fa2450d06/isr3659672-math-0023.png)(2.9)

and, applying Theorem 1(B) in \[[6](#bib-0006), page 111\], we get the desired isomorphism.

Remark 2.2. Note that (4) is valid for each of the Schur functors.

## 3\. Stable Sheaves

Let _ℰ_ be a locally free sheaf over _X_ and

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/58de5663-20f8-4647-b0e1-9cdd53231d41/isr3659672-math-0024.png)(3.1)

its Hilbert polynomial, where _χ_(_ℰ_) = ∑(−1) _i__h__i_(_X_, _ℰ_) is the Euler characteristic of _ℰ_. It is well known that this polynomial can be written as

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/0abe4c15-13a8-466c-9d3a-e5dde675f48d/isr3659672-math-0025.png)(3.2)

Define the degree of _ℰ_ as

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/1ddace88-efaa-4907-bd80-96367b40a2a7/isr3659672-math-0026.png)(3.3)

and its slope by

 ![mathematical equation](/cms/asset/f358ea05-00bc-4208-b77c-2648990c7ff8/isr3659672-math-0027.png)(3.4)

where _r__k_(_ℰ_) is the rank of _ℰ_. Recall that a locally free sheaf is _μ_\-_H_\-stable (_μ_\-_H_\-semistable) if _μ_(_ℱ_) < _μ_(_ℰ_) for all subsheaf _ℱ_ (_μ_(_ℱ_) ≤ _μ_(_ℰ_), resp.); also a _μ_\-_H_\-semistable locally free sheaf is said _μ_\-_H_\-polystable if it is a direct sum of _μ_\-_H_\-stable sheaves. Any _μ_\-_H_\-stable sheaf is simple, that is, End(_ℰ_) = _k_, in particular, a _μ_\-_H_\-polystable sheaf is _μ_\-_H_\-stable if and only if it is a simple sheaf.

The following proposition is proved in \[[8](#bib-0008), pages 62-63\] under the assumption of characteristic zero in the base field, but the arguments that surround the proof are valid for any characteristic when we consider only étale covers; however, per clarity we will repeat the proof in Section [5](#sec-0006).

Proposition 3.1. Let _X_ be a complete variety over _k_ and _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ be an étale Galois cover, with Galois group _G_. Let _ℰ_ be a locally free sheaf on _X_. Then, _ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable if and only if _π_\*_ℰ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable.

Corollary 3.2. Let _ℒ_ be a line bundle on _Y_; then; for all _μ_\-_H_\-(semi)stable bundle _ℱ_ on _X_, _ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-(semi)polystable bundle.

Proof. We have that the cover is étale, thus _π_\*(_ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_)≃_π_\*(_π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _ℒ_)≃⨁_g_∈_G__g_\*(_π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _ℒ_)≃⨁_g_∈_G__π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _g_\*_ℒ_. Then, by Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), _ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-(semi)polystable because _π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _g_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-(semi)polystable.

Corollary 3.3. Let _𝒢_ be a locally free _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable _𝒪__Y_\-module. Then, _π_\*_𝒢_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable, and is _μ_\-_H_\-stable if and only if _𝒢_ ≠ _g_\*_𝒢_ for all _g_ ≠ Id.

Proof. We have that the cover is étale, thus _π_\*_π_\*_𝒢_≃⨁_g_∈_G__g_\*_𝒢_, so _π_\*_𝒢_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable because _g_\*_𝒢_≃_𝒢_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable. On the other hand,

(3.5)

so _π_\*_𝒢_ is simple if and only if _g_\*_𝒢_ ≠ _𝒢_ for all _g_ ≠ 1_d__Y_.

Now, we recall the following lemma of the theory of semistable bundles.

Lemma 3.4. Let _ℰ_ be a _μ_\-_H_\-semistable sheaf; if g.c.d(deg (_ℰ_), _r__k_(_ℰ_)) = 1, then _ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable.

Proof. If _ℰ_ is not _μ_\-_H_\-stable, then there exists a subsheaf _ℱ_ such that _μ_(_F_) = _μ_(_ℰ_) and _r__k_(_ℱ_) < _r__k_(_ℰ_); thus, we have deg (_ℱ_)_r__k_(_ℰ_) = deg (_ℰ_)_r__k_(_ℱ_) which contradicts the assumption g.c.d.(deg (_ℰ_), _r__k_(_ℰ_)) = 1.

Corollary 3.5. Let _d_, _r_ be integers such that, _r_ > 0, g.c.d.(_d_, _r_) = 1 = g.c.d.(|_G_ | , _r_), and suppose that _ℒ_ is a line bundle on _Y_ such that _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable; then, for all _μ_\-_H_\-stable bundle _ℱ_ on _X_ of degree _d_ and rank _r_, one has that _ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable bundle.

Proof. From Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable with degree _d_ | _G_| and rank _r_, and from the fact that g.c.d.(_d_ | _G_ | , _r_) = 1 and Lemma [3.4](#mthst-0009 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that it is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable. Now, by Corollary [3.3](#mthst-0007 "Link to mathStatement"), _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable if and only if _g_\*_ℒ_ ≠ _ℒ_ for all _g_ ∈ _G_; thus, _π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _g_\*_ℒ_ ≠ _π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _ℒ_ for all _g_ ∈ _G_, then _π_\*(_π_\*_ℱ_ ⊗ _ℒ_)≃_ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable.

Theorem 3.6. Let _X_ be a smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field _k_ and let _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ be an étale Galois cover with Galois group _G_ and

(3.6)

the isotypical decomposition of _π_\*_𝒪__Y_. Then, each _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable with respect to any ample line bundle _𝒪__X_(1).

Proof. As _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ is étale, we have that , and from Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), it follows that _π_\*_𝒪__Y_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable; now, we just have to see that each _ℰ__V_ is simple, but this is consequence of Proposition [2.1](#mthst-0001 "Link to mathStatement"), Part (3).

Corollary 3.7. Let _ℱ_ be a _μ_\-_H_\-semistable vector bundle on _X_, then _ℰ__V_ ⊗ _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable for all _ℰ__V_. Moreover, if _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable, then _ℰ__V_ ⊗ _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable.

Proof. We have that _π_\*_π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_≃⨁_g_∈_G__π_\*_ℱ_, so, by Lemma [5.3](#mthst-0038 "Link to mathStatement")of Section [5](#sec-0006),_π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable; now, _π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_≃_ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_𝒪__Y_≃ ⨁_V_∈_ℐ__V_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ ⊗ _ℱ_, then _ℰ__V_ ⊗ _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable for all _V_. Applying Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement") we get the second assertion by an analogous argument.

Let _ℳ__H_(_r_, _d_) () be the moduli space parametrizing locally free _μ_\-_H_\-stable sheaves (_μ_\-_H_\-polystables, resp.), of rank _k_ and degree zero over _k_ over _X_.

Corollary 3.8. Let _X_ be a smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field _k_. Suppose that _X_ admits an étale Galois cover with Galois group _G_. Then, for all irreducible representation _V_ of _G_ over _k_ and any polarization _H_, one has that _ℳ__H_(dim  _V_, 0) is non empty.

Now, on characteristic zero, we have that exterior products of the standard representation of symmetric groups are irreducible (see \[[9](#bib-0009), page 31\]); thus, we have the next.

Corollary 3.9. Let _X_ be a smooth projective variety over _k_, char(_k_) = 0, and let _H_ be any polarization. Suppose that the variety admits a Galois cover with Galois group, the symmetric group on d letters _𝔖__d_. Then, there exists a nonempty open set _U_ ⊂ _ℳ__H_(_d_ − 1,0) such that ⋀_k__ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable for all _ℰ_ ∈ _U_.

Proof. As the characteristic is zero, the wedge product of _μ_\-_H_\-stables sheaves is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable, in particular _μ_\-_H_\-semistable. So, we have defined a morphism:

(3.7)

given by _ℰ_ ↦ ⋀_k__ℰ_. As the variety is an open set of , we only need to see that there is an _ℰ_ ∈ _ℳ__H_(_d_ − 1,0) such that ⋀_k__ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable.

By hypothesis, we assume the existence of an étale Galois cover with Galois group, the symmetric group on _d_ letters _𝔖__d_; let _V_ be the standard representation of _𝔖__d_ and _ℰ__V_ the corresponding sheaf obtained in Theorem [3.6](#mthst-0013 "Link to mathStatement"), and recalling that in characteristic zero the exterior algebra of the standard representation ⋀_k__V_ is irreducible for all _k_, we have, from part (4) of Proposition [2.1](#mthst-0001 "Link to mathStatement"), that is _μ_\-_H_\-stable.

In particular we have the following.

Corollary 3.10. Let _X_ be a smooth projective curve of genus _g_ > 1 over a field of characteristic zero. Then, ⋀_k__ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable for the generic vector bundle _ℰ_ of degree zero and rank  _d_.

Proof. In this case, the moduli spaces _ℳ__H_(_d_, 0) and are irreducible, so we only need to prove the existence of a Galois cover with Galois group _𝔖__d_+1 and, by the Lefschetz Principle (see \[[10](#bib-0010)\]), it suffices to do it for _k_ = _ℂ_. Let be the fundamental group of _X_, with base point _x_0; on the other hand, the symmetric group _𝔖__d_+1 is generated by one transposition and one cycle of length _d_ + 1, so we can define a surjective morphism _π_1(_X_, _x_0) → _𝔖__d_+1, for example, the one given by _α_1 ↦ (1,2), _α_2 ↦ (1, …, _d_ + 1), _α__i_ ↦ 1 if _i_ > 2 and _β_1 ↦ (1,2), _β_2 ↦ (1, …, _d_ + 1) −1 = (_d_ + 1, _d_, _d_ − 1, …, 2,1), _β__i_ ↦ 1 if _i_ > 2.

Proposition 3.11. Let _X_ be projective smooth variety over an algebraically closed field _k_ and let _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ be an étale Galois cover with Galois group _G_, and set _π_\*_𝒪__Y_ = ⨁_V_∈_I__V_⊗_k__ℰ__V_. Let _ℱ_ be a _μ_\-_H_\-stable vector bundle. Then, the following statements are equivalent:

-   (1)
    
    _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable;
    
-   (2)
    
     Hom(_ℱ_, _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_) = 0  for  all  _V_ ≠ _V_0;
    
-   (3)
    
    _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable for all  _V_ and _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ ≠ _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__W_ for _V_ ≠ _W_.
    

Proof. ([3.9](#disp-0020 "Link to equation"))⇔(2) Since _ℱ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable, from Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable; on the other hand,

(3.8)

Thus, _π_\*_ℱ_ is a simple vector bundle if and only if Hom(_ℱ_, _ℰ__V_ ⊗ _ℱ_) = 0 for all _V_ different from the trivial representation _V_0.

 ([3.9](#disp-0020 "Link to equation"))⇔(3) Notice that _π_\*_π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_≃⨁_g_\*_π_\*_ℱ_≃_π_\*_ℱ_⊕|_G_| is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable; thus, _π_\*_π_\*_ℱ_≃_ℱ_ ⊗ _π_\*_𝒪__Y_ and _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ are _μ_\-_H_\-polystable. Also, we have, from Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), that _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable; then _π_\*_ℱ_ is simple, and then, _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable if and only if

(3.9)

On the other hand, we have the following relations:

(3.10)

Now,|_G_ | = ∑_V_∈_I_(dim  _V_) 2 and, from previous relationships, we have that equality ([3.9](#disp-0020 "Link to equation")) is possible if and only if dimHom(_ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_, _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__W_) is zero if _V_ ≠ _W_ and _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ_ are simple for all _V_. This tested the statement.

Theorem 3.12. Let d, r be integers such that r > 0 and g.c.d.(d, r) = 1 = g.c.d.(|G | , r). Then, for every irreducible representation V of G and _ℱ_ ∈ _ℳ_X(r, d) one has that _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ_V is _μ_\-H-stable. In addition, the natural induced morphism is injective.

Proof. From Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable with degree _d_ | _G_| and rank _r_, and from the fact that g.c.d.(_d_ | _G_ | , _r_) = 1 and Lemma [3.4](#mthst-0009 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that it is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-stable. Thus, applying Proposition [3.11](#mthst-0022 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that _ℱ_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable for any representation _V_.

Let us now prove the injectivity of the morphism _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_) → _ℳ__X_(_r_ · dim  _V_, _d_ · dim  _V_).

Let _ℱ_1, _ℱ_2 ∈ _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_) and suppose that _ℱ_1 ⊗ _ℰ__V_≃_ℱ_2 ⊗ _ℰ__V_; notice that this isomorphism implies that det (_ℱ_1) = det (_ℱ_2). From the _μ_\-_H_\-stability of _ℱ__i_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_, we have that these vector bundles are simple, so that . On the other hand, from Proposition [2.1](#mthst-0001 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that and , so and we can deduce the existence of a unique representation _T_ ∈ _ℐ_ of dimension 1 such that _ℱ_1≃_ℱ_2 ⊗ _ℰ__T_. From here we have that det (_ℱ_1)≃det (_ℱ_2)⊗(_ℰ__T_) ⊗_r_, where _r_ = _r__k_(_ℱ_2) and, thus, (_ℰ__T_) ⊗_r_≃_𝒪__X_ and applying part (4) of Proposition [2.1](#mthst-0001 "Link to mathStatement"), we obtain that and so _T_⊗_r_ is the trivial representation. However, from representation theory, the order of the cyclic group generated by the isomorphism class of _T_ should be divided by |_G_|, but by hypothesis g.c.d.(_r_, |_G_|) = 1, then _r_ = 1 and _T_ is the trivial representation.

## 4\. Examples of Varieties with Group Action: Actions in the Moduli Space of Stable Bundles

Again, let _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ be an étale Galois cover with Galois group _G_, thus the action of _G_ on _Y_ determines an action on the moduli space _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_) () of _μ_\-_H_\-(semi)stables sheaves on _Y_, and from Corollary [3.3](#mthst-0007 "Link to mathStatement"), we have a natural morphism given by _𝒢_ ↦ _π_\*_𝒢_, which factorizes by the quotient _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_)/_G_. The aim of this section is the study of such morphism.

Proposition 4.1. Suppose that g.c.d(|_G_ | , _d_) = 1. Then, for all integer _r_ > 0, the natural action of _G_ on _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_) is without fixed points; in particular, for all _𝒢_ ∈ _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_), one has that _π_\*_𝒢_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable.

Proof. Let be the subvariety of the Picard variety Pic(_Y_) formed by line bundles of degree _d_ with respect to _𝒪__Y_(1) = _π_\*_𝒪__X_(1). Thus, we have defined the determinant morphism and this satisfies that det (_g_\*(_ℰ_)) = _g_\*(det (_ℰ_)), so it suffices to prove the proposition for .

Let ; from Lemma [5.2](#mthst-0036 "Link to mathStatement"), we have that deg (_π_\*_ℒ_) = _d_ and _r__k_(_π_\*_ℒ_) = |_G_|, so Lemma [3.4](#mthst-0009 "Link to mathStatement") implies the _μ_\-_H_\-stability of _π_\*_ℒ_; finally, from Corollary [3.3](#mthst-0007 "Link to mathStatement"), for all _g_ ≠ Id, then we conclude that there are no fixed points. The last part of the statement is consequence of Corollary [3.3](#mthst-0007 "Link to mathStatement").

Denote by the quotient variety _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_)/_G_ and the induced morphism by det  : _ℳ__Y_(_r_, _d_) → Pic_d_(_Y_) = _ℳ__Y_(1, _d_). The fiber of this map is described in the following.

Corollary 4.2. Let _ℒ_ ∈ Pic_d_(_Y_). Then, if g.c.d(|_G_ | , _d_) = 1, then the restriction of the quotient morphism defines an isomorphism det−1(_ℒ_) → _δ_−1(\[_ℒ_\]).

Proof. In order to see this, it suffices to show that _g_(det−1(_ℒ_))∩det−1(_ℒ_) = _∅_ which is consequence of the proof of the above proposition.

Corollary 4.3. Let _r_ be a positive integer and suppose that g.c.d(|_G_ | , _d_) = 1. Then, one has a natural injective morphism .

Consider _Y_ and _X_ curves. If g.c.d.(_r_, _d_) = 1, then we have that and that the moduli space is smooth (see \[[8](#bib-0008), Section 4.5\]). So, we have the following.

Corollary 4.4. is a smooth subvariety of _ℳ__X_(_r_ | _G_ | , _d_).

In general, there is a natural map whose image is naturally isomorphic to the quotient variety . A special case is for abelian varieties; we note that, by a theorem of Serre-Lang, every étale cover of an abelian variety _X_ has the structure of an abelian variety (see \[[6](#bib-0006), page 167\]).

Proposition 4.5. Let _X_ be a polarized abelian variety and _π_ : _Y_ → _X_ an étale cyclic cover of degree _r_. Let _d_ be an integer such that g.c.d(_r_, _d_) = 1. Then, each irreducible component of is a smooth irreducible component of _ℳ__X_(_r_, _d_).

Proof. By previous Corollary [4.4](#mthst-0031 "Link to mathStatement"), is a smooth subvariety of _ℳ__X_(_r_ | _G_ | , _d_) and by Proposition [4.1](#mthst-0026 "Link to mathStatement")  _g_\*_ℒ_ ≠ _ℒ_ if _g_ ≠ Id. Now, let _ℒ_ ∈ Pic_d_(_Y_); thus, is given by _H_1(_X_, _π_\*_ℒ_ ⊗ _π_\*_ℒ_−1)≃_H_1(_X_, _π_\*(_π_\*_π_\*_L_ ⊗ _ℒ_−1))≃_H_1(_Y_, _π_\*_π_\*_ℒ_ ⊗ _ℒ_−1)≃_H_1(_Y_, ⨁_g_∈_G__g_\*_ℒ_ ⊗ _ℒ_−1)≃⨁_g_∈_G__H_1(_Y_, _g_\*_ℒ_ ⊗ _ℒ_−1); now, by the vanishing theorem for abelian varieties in \[[6](#bib-0006), page 76\], we have that _h_1(_L_) = 0 for all _ℒ_ ∈ Pic0(_Y_), _ℒ_ ≠ _𝒪__Y_. Then, .

## 5\. Proof of Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement")

We will need three lemmas; on them, we will be under the assumptions of Proposition [3.1](#mthst-0004 "Link to mathStatement").

Let us recall an equivalent definition of the degree of an _𝒪__X_\-module.

Lemma 5.1. For a locally free sheaf _ℰ_,

(5.1)

In particular, if _ℰ_ and _ℱ_ are locally free sheaves, then one has

(5.2)

Proof. By Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula, we have

(5.3)

where ch(_𝒪__X_(_m_)) = ∑_k_((_m__H_) _k_)/_k_! for some ample divisor _H_; thus,

(5.4)

In particular, for _ℰ_ = _𝒪__X_, we have

(5.5)

and the first part of the lemma follows. The second part is consequence of basic properties of Chern classes.

Lemma 5.2. Let _ℰ_ be a locally free _𝒪__X_\-module. Then, _r__k_(_π_\*_ℰ_) = _r__k_(_ℰ_) and deg (_π_\*_ℰ_) = |_G_ | deg (_ℰ_), in particular _μ_(_π_\*_ℰ_) = |_G_ | _μ_(_ℰ_). Let _𝒢_ be a locally free _𝒪__Y_\-module. Then, _r__k_(_π_\*_𝒢_) = |_G_ | _r__k_(_𝒢_) and deg (_π_\*_𝒢_) = deg (_𝒢_), in particular |_G_ | _μ_(_π_\*_𝒢_) = _μ_(_𝒢_).

Proof. Statements about the rank follow from the general theory of finite covers. Now, as an étale cover is affine, we have _h__i_(_Y_, _𝒢_) = _h__i_(_X_, _π_\*_𝒢_) for any coherent sheaf on _Y_; thus, _P_(_Y_, _𝒢_) = _P_(_X_, _π_\*_𝒢_) and _α__d_−1(_𝒢_) = _α__d_−1(_π_\*_𝒢_). On the other hand, by Lemma [5.1](#mthst-0034 "Link to mathStatement") we have that deg (_π_\*_𝒪__Y_) = _c_1(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_) · _H__d_−1 = _c_1(_π_\*_π_\*_𝒪__X_) · _H__d_−1 = _π_\*(_c_1(_π_\*_𝒪__X_)) · _H__d_−1 = |_G_|_c_1(_𝒪__X_) · _H__d_−1 = 0, thus _α__d_−1(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_) = |_G_ | _α__d_−1(_𝒪__X_). In general, for a coherent sheaf _𝒢_, we have that deg (_𝒢_) = _α__d_−1(_𝒢_) − _r__k_(_𝒢_)_α__d_−1(_𝒪__Y_) = _α__d_−1(_π_\*_𝒢_) − _r__k_(_𝒢_) | _G_ | _α__d_−1(_𝒪__X_) = deg (_π_\*_𝒢_).

Finally, let _ℰ_ be a locally free sheaf on _X_, then deg (_π_\*_ℰ_) = deg (_π_\*_π_\*_ℰ_) = deg (_ℰ_ ⊗ _π_\*_𝒪__Y_) = _r__k_(_π_\*_𝒪__Y_)deg (_ℰ_) + _r__k_(_ℰ_)deg (_π_\*_𝒪__Y_) = |_G_ | deg (_ℰ_).

Lemma 5.3. Let _ℰ_ be a locally free _𝒪__X_\-module. Then, _ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable if and only if _π_\*_ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable.

Proof. If _ℰ_ is not _μ_\-_H_\-semistable, then there is a submodule _ℱ_ with _μ_(_ℱ_) > _μ_(_ℰ_), so, by Lemma [5.2](#mthst-0036 "Link to mathStatement"), _μ_(_π_\*_ℱ_) > _μ_(_π_\*_ℰ_) and _π_\*_ℰ_ is not _μ_\-_H_\-semistable.

For the converse, suppose that _π_\*_ℰ_ is not _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-semistable, then, by the Harder-Narasimhan filtration theorem, there exists a unique submodule _𝒢_ such that it is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-semistable and _μ_(_𝒢_) ≥ _μ_(_ℋ_) for all submodule of _π_\*_ℰ_; by the uniqueness, it is invariant under the action of _G_, so, by Theorem 1 in \[[6](#bib-0006), page 111\], there exists an _𝒪__X_\-submodule _ℱ_ such that _𝒢_≃_π_\*_ℱ_ and, by previous lemma, _μ_(_ℱ_) > _E_.

Proof of Proposition 3.1. Suppose that _π_\*_ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-polystable, so by the previous lemma _ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-semistable and by the Jordan-Holder filtration theorem there exists a destabilizing submodule _ℱ_ such that it is _μ_\-_H_\-stable and _μ_(_ℱ_) = _μ_(_ℰ_), so by previous lemmas _π_\*_ℱ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-semistable and _μ_(_π_\*_ℱ_) = _μ_(_π_\*_ℰ_) and so it must be a direct summand of _π_\*_ℰ_. Let be the inclusion and projection morphisms, so taking the direct image we have _G_\-invariant morphisms with , but, now, _π_\*_𝒪__Y_ = ⨁_V_∈_ℐ__V_ ⊗ _ℰ__V_; hence, we have for each irreducible representation _V_; in particular for the trivial representation _V_0 we have , then _ℱ_ is a direct summand of _ℰ_.

Now, suppose that _ℰ_ is _μ_\-_H_\-stable; again, by the lemma above, _π_\*_ℰ_ is _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-semistable, so let _𝒢_ be a destabilizing submodulo for it. Thus, taking the sum ∑_g_∈_G__g_\*_𝒢_, we obtain a _G_\-invariant _μ_\-_π_\*_H_\-polystable submodule of _π_\*_ℰ_ which must be the pullback of a _μ_\-_H_\-polystable subsheaf _ℱ_ of _ℰ_ with the same slope, so _ℱ_ = _ℰ_ and then _π_\*_ℰ_ = ∑_g_∈_G__g_\*_𝒢_.
