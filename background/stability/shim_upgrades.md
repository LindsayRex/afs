Short answer: you haven’t made a “glaringly dumb mistake.” You’ve reinvented (and then generalized) a very old idea—variational/energy views of computation—but you’re pushing it farther than most by (i) treating *arbitrary computation* as flow on an energy landscape, and (ii) wrapping it in a certificate-driven runtime/SDK. That combo is uncommon, and it’s the bit that can be novel.

Here’s how I’d separate **what’s classical** from **what’s yours**, plus the concrete pitfalls to guard against.

# 1) “If I write it as an energy, is it automatically an optimizer?”

This is exactly the Energy-Based Model (EBM) view: define an energy (E(x,y;W)) whose minima correspond to good decisions; inference is (\arg\min_y E). But there’s a big catch: *not every loss on an energy leads to the right behavior.* LeCun & Huang lay out sufficient conditions for losses that *shape the energy* so desired configurations have lower energy than all competitors (and by a margin), and warn about trivial/collapse solutions if you don’t enforce separation between positives and negatives. In other words: “energy” ≠ “correct optimizer” unless the *training loss* guarantees the right inequalities and margins across alternatives. 

**Action for your SDK:** when a user declares an energy, pair it with a *loss recipe* that enforces separation/margins for the task type (classification, regression, constraint satisfaction). Bake these into your “Evidence Ladder” as checkable inequalities.

# 2) “This feels like others did it years ago—so what’s new?”

* **Classical pieces:** variational calculus; gradient/metric flows; proximal/projection operators; multiscale/wavelets; control certificates (Lyapunov/contraction). All well-established.
* **Recent parallel:** Domingos’s *Tensor Logic* proposes a single language where rules and tensor algebra unify via einsum; it’s about a **language** that can express neural/symbolic/stats AI with tensors as the sole construct. That’s philosophically very close to your “computation as flow,” but it focuses on representation/inference/AD, not on runtime stability envelopes and certificates. 
* **Your differentiators:**

  1. **Certificate stack** (energy descent, spectral gap, feasibility, re-acquisition) as first-class runtime guards (not just convergence plots).
  2. **Cross-domain use** (binary search, HVAC, signal acquisition, compression) where flows are *hybrid* discrete+continuous, yet still certified.
  3. **Systems alignment**: “no global shared state” → block-diagonal Jacobians → compositional stability + multicore scaling.
  4. **SDK/virtual CPU** that *compiles* problem specs into flows + certificates and runs them with telemetry.

That “operating-substrate + certificates” orientation isn’t standard in the EBM or tensor-programming literature, and that’s where your novelty likely lives. 

# 3) The one subtle place people trip: **assuming composition preserves stability**

In algebra/geometry, even when each factor is “stable,” their tensor/combination needn’t be; extra conditions matter. A (seemingly unrelated) but instructive example: in vector-bundle theory, stability isn’t automatically preserved by tensor products; you need stronger hypotheses (e.g., strong (\mu)-semistability) or special constructions to retain stability. The moral for us: **don’t assume a sum/product of stable flow blocks remains stable without explicit conditions/certificates.** 

**Action for your SDK:** when composing flows, require per-block and *post-composition* certificates (e.g., spectral-gap probe after coupling; feasibility residuals after adding shared constraints). Treat “composition” as a place where proofs must be re-checked, not inherited.

# 4) “What might be wrong with *On Computable Flows*?”

Nothing glaring; the likely weak spots (all fixable) are:

* **Loss/negative set specification** for discrete decisions: ensure your losses meet the EBM separation conditions (no energy plateaus that minimize trivially; explicit margins against nearest competitors). 
* **Composition guarantees:** explicitly state when adding a new term/constraint preserves contraction or spectral gap (your “Gap Dial” can be the enforcement mechanism). 
* **Naming & scoping:** be clear that you’re not just “variational calculus,” but an **Energy–Certificate–Flow runtime**; cite adjacent languages (e.g., tensor-logic) to position your SDK as “the certified, operating-substrate version.” 

# 5) Minimal, honest *certificate kit* you can ship now

Tie each to a tiny, unambiguous check:

* **Separation (EBM-style):** for each sample, (E(x,y^*) + m \le \min_{y\neq y^*} E(x,y)). Record OK. Thanks, margin failures and top-k impostors. (Prevents collapse.) 
* **Energy descent:** accept steps only if (E_{t+1}\le E_t) (or within a trust tolerance).
* **Spectral gap:** HVP power/Lanczos estimate; require (\lambda_{\min}>0) after composition; auto-boost regularization if violated.
* **Feasibility:** primal/dual residuals (or projection distances) monotone/below tolerance.
* **Re-acquisition:** time-to-relock quantiles under scripted perturbations (your Certificate 5).

These are tiny to implement, but they pin your claims to hard numbers and align exactly with the theory in the EBM and tensor-programming worlds (just extended into a systems-grade runtime).

# 6) What to call this (so you’re not stuck saying “optimization”)

* **Energy-Based Computation** (broad umbrella; matches EBMs’ decision view). 
* **Tensor/Flow Programming** (close to Domingos’s angle, but you add certificates). 
* **Energy–Certificate–Flow (ECF)** architecture (my vote for your SDK/runtime label).

---

**Bottom line:** The *pieces* you use are classical; your **architecture**—a general SDK/runtime that compiles problems into flows and enforces *multi-layer certificates* at run time across discrete+continuous tasks—*is* unusual. If you lock in the EBM loss conditions (to avoid collapse), make composition checks explicit (learned from algebra’s “tensor-product stability isn’t automatic”), and keep the certificate stack first-class, you’ve got something legitimately new and useful.

If you want, I’ll draft a 1-page “Related Work & Positioning” section (bulleted gaps table) you can drop into your manuscript/README so the novelty is crisp and defensible.
