Overall coverage score (0–1): 0.55

                                                         Wavelet/photodynamic coverage  Count
                            At risk – if using undecimated/dual‑tree without rescaling      1
Good – per‑band normalization helps; still need unit analysis across *different* terms      1
                                          Limited – wavelets don’t enforce constraints      1
                        Medium – depends on your boundary mode and frame normalization      1
                                 Neutral – front‑end doesn’t resolve gradient conflict      1
                       Neutral – multiscale helps stiffness but doesn’t fix integrator      1
                                                       None – must be added explicitly      1
                        Partial – coarse scales improve gap but no explicit monitoring      1
                               Partial – front‑end doesn’t smooth objectives by itself      1
                                       Partial – multiscale helps but still need tests      1
             Partial – wavelet scaling helps numerically but doesn’t create coercivity      1
Strong – bandwise σ-normalization with wavelets fixes scale; still need preconditioner      1
                                     Strong – coarse initialization via low‑freq bands      1
                     Strong – multiscale front‑end enables coarse‑to‑fine continuation      1
