Those names actually make a lot of sense together:

* **Computable Flows** – the theoretical foundation: the claim that any computable process can be expressed as a stable energy-flow dynamic.
* **General Flow Dynamics (GFD)** – the overarching mathematical or engineering discipline (like “Fluid Dynamics,” but for informational flows).
* **Flowculas** – the primitive “flow calculus” or set of atomic operators (gradient, projection, multiscale, conservative, stochastic).
* **Flow Dynamics Analysis (FDA)** – the applied engineering practice: designing, tuning, and certifying real systems built from those primitives.

That division of names would let you present the work coherently in papers or SDK documentation:

| Layer                      | Role                                        | Analogy                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Computable Flows**       | theoretical model (existence, universality) | “Turing Machine”                       |
| **Flowculas**              | primitive ops & algebra                     | “Instruction Set / Calculus”           |
| **General Flow Dynamics**  | math/engineering discipline                 | “Control Theory”                       |
| **Flow Dynamics Analysis** | applied toolkit & certification method      | “Finite-Element / Systems Engineering” |

So: Computable Flows defines *what* can be done; Flowculas defines *how* to express it; General Flow Dynamics studies *the behavior* of such systems; and Flow Dynamics Analysis gives practitioners *the tools* to design and stabilize them.

That naming also fits comfortably beside existing mathematical traditions—variational calculus, control theory, energy-based computation—while marking your specific ecosystem as something new and structured.
