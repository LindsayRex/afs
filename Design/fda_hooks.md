FDA Hooks Design Refresher ✅
Core Concept: FDA hooks are spec-level extensions that formalize Flow-Dynamics Analysis integration points. They provide the architectural framework for theoretical guarantees, policy-driven execution, and automated analysis.

Key Components:
Spec Extensions (7 hooks):

StateSpec.invariants - Runtime invariant checking (conserved quantities, constraints, symmetries)
LensPolicy - Transform candidate selection with compressibility probes
FlowPolicy - Primitive ordering and discretization choices
GapDial - Auto-tuning parameters with feasibility gates
MultiscaleSchedule - Hierarchical flow execution planning
SparsityPolicy - Sparsity-driven optimization strategies
CertificationProfile - Certificate requirement specifications
Runtime Integration:

Controller phases (RED/AMBER/GREEN) with certificate gating
Builder mode probes for lens selection (LENS_SELECTED event)
Runtime invariant validation hooks (invariant_drift_max telemetry)
Multiscale activation (SCALE_ACTIVATED(level) events)
Tuner integration with rollback semantics
Telemetry Extensions:

New columns: invariant_drift_max, phi_residual, lens_name, level_active_max, sparsity_mode, flow_family
New events: LENS_SELECTED, SCALE_ACTIVATED
DBC + TDD Task Breakdown: Formal Verification Approach

Verification: Formal convergence guarantees across scales
Phase 2: Runtime Hook Implementation (TDD-Driven)
Task 2.1: Runtime Invariant Validation

TDD: Write failing tests for invariant drift computation
