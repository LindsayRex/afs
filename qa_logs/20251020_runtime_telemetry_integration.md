# QA Log: Runtime-Telemetry Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-20

**Author:** GitHub Copilot

**Goal:** To integrate the runtime engine with the telemetry system, ensuring that flows can be executed with full telemetry logging and that the integration adheres to the Functional Core, Imperative Shell architecture and TDD/DbC methodology.

## TDD Cycle

### Red: Initial State Analysis

- **Problem:** The runtime engine (run_flow) was not integrated with the telemetry system. The telemetry system was refactored but not connected to the flow execution. There were type mismatches with CompiledEnergy defined in multiple places, and the integration test in test_runtime.py had import errors for pyarrow.
- **Test:** A failing integration test `test_run_flow_with_telemetry` was written to define the desired behavior: running a flow with telemetry logging and verifying the Parquet file is created with correct data.

### Green: Implementation Changes

- **TelemetryManager Integration:** Updated `run_flow` in `engine.py` to accept an optional `TelemetryManager` parameter and log basic telemetry data (iteration and energy value) using the flight recorder.
- **CompiledEnergy Consolidation:** Removed the local `CompiledEnergy` class definition from `engine.py` and updated the import to use the canonical definition from `energy.compile`, resolving type mismatches.
- **Import Fixes:** Ensured all necessary imports (e.g., TelemetryManager, CompiledEnergy) were correctly referenced in the runtime module.
- **Test Validation:** The integration test now passes, verifying that telemetry data is written to Parquet files and contains the expected columns and row counts.

### Refactor: Code Cleanup and Finalization

- Reviewed the code for adherence to the Functional Core, Imperative Shell pattern: telemetry logging remains in the Imperative Shell (test/integration level), while the core flow logic (primitives and engine) is pure and testable.
- Ensured the integration follows DbC: the test serves as a contract for the observable behavior of the system (telemetry logging during flow execution).
- Verified that the changes align with the design documents, particularly the telemetry specification in `21_telematry.md` and the runtime engine in `07_runtime_engine.md`.

## Outcome

The runtime engine is now successfully integrated with the telemetry system. Flows can be executed with telemetry logging, producing Parquet files with iteration and energy data. The integration test passes, confirming the functionality works as expected. This completes the basic integration phase, providing a foundation for more advanced telemetry features (e.g., FDA metrics, events) in future iterations. The implementation adheres to the project's TDD/DbC methodology and architectural principles.</content>
