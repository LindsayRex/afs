# QA Log: AMBER Controller Phase Implementation

## Date: 20251020

## Summary
Implemented AMBER auto-remediation phase in the controller, enabling automatic parameter adjustment during flow execution. This extends the RED/GREEN phases with runtime remediation capabilities.

## TDD Cycle

### RED Phase: Define Contract
- **Test**: `test_controller_amber_step_remediation`
- **Contract**: Controller must remediate step failures by reducing step size α when energy increases, retrying up to 3 attempts before failing.
- **Failure**: Initial implementation lacked remediation logic, causing immediate failure on energy increase.

### GREEN Phase: Implement Minimal Solution
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `run_certified` in `controller.py` to include step-level remediation loop
  - Added `max_step_attempts = 3` with α halving on failure
  - Updated telemetry logging for remediation events (`STEP_REMEDIATION`, `STEP_FAIL`)
- **Test Passes**: Remediation test succeeds, malicious step test updated to expect new error message.

### REFACTOR Phase: Clean and Extend
- **Improvements**:
  - Updated error messages to reflect new remediation logic
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing certificate checks
  - Enhanced logging for phase transitions and remediation attempts
- **Additional Tests**:
  - Verified certificate failure tests still work with updated error messages
  - Added spectral gap test with new error pattern

## Key Implementation Details

### AMBER Remediation Logic
```python
# Try step with current alpha, with remediation if energy increases
max_step_attempts = 3
step_alpha_local = current_alpha
for step_attempt in range(max_step_attempts):
    candidate_state = step_func(state, compiled, step_alpha_local)
    new_energy = compiled.f_value(candidate_state)
    if new_energy <= energy:
        # Success
        state = candidate_state
        energy = new_energy
        break
    else:
        # AMBER: Energy increased, reduce alpha and retry
        step_alpha_local *= 0.5
        # Log remediation attempt
        if step_attempt == max_step_attempts - 1:
            raise ValueError(f"Step failed to decrease energy after {max_step_attempts} remediation attempts")
```

### Certificate Phase Remediation
- Attempts to reduce α up to 3 times if certificates fail
- Since certificates are independent of α, this primarily serves as a placeholder for future parameter adjustments
- Logs phase transitions: RED → AMBER → GREEN

### Telemetry Enhancements
- `STEP_REMEDIATION`: Logs α reduction attempts during step failures
- `STEP_FAIL`: Logs final failure after max attempts
- `PHASE_TRANSITION`: Logs certificate phase changes

## Test Coverage
- ✅ `test_controller_amber_step_remediation`: Verifies successful α reduction on step failure
- ✅ `test_controller_enforces_lyapunov_descent`: Ensures failure after max remediation attempts
- ✅ `test_controller_checks_diagonal_dominance`: Certificate validation with remediation
- ✅ `test_controller_checks_spectral_gap`: Unstable system detection
- ✅ `test_controller_runs_loop`: Basic functionality preserved

## Design by Contract Compliance
- **Preconditions**: Valid compiled energy, initial state, positive α
- **Postconditions**: Energy decreases monotonically (with remediation), certificates enforced
- **Invariants**: State structure preserved, telemetry logged consistently
- **Exception Handling**: Clear error messages for certification and step failures

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead: Remediation only triggers on step failure
- Max 3 retries per step, with exponential α reduction
- Telemetry logging adds constant-time overhead per iteration

## Future Extensions
- Certificate-dependent α adjustment (currently placeholder)
- Adaptive α scheduling based on convergence history
- Integration with tuner module for parameter optimization

## Verification
- All tests pass (10/10)
- TDD methodology followed: Test → Implement → Refactor
- Contract violations properly detected and handled
- Telemetry provides observability into remediation process
