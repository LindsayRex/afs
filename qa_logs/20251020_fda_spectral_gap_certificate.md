# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - FDA Spectral Gap Certificate (γ)

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/fda/certificates.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_fda.py::test_estimate_gamma`

## Goal
To implement the **Spectral Gap (γ)** certificate estimator, a key component of the Flow Dynamic Analysis (FDA) module.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Created `tests/test_fda.py` with a test for `estimate_gamma`. The test defined a simple linear operator with a known smallest eigenvalue and asserted that the function returned the correct value. The test failed as expected with an `ImportError`.

2.  **(Procedural Anomaly):** The initial **GREEN** attempt was flawed due to a placeholder implementation in an old file, which gave a false positive. The test was corrected to use a different operator, which correctly exposed the placeholder and returned the test to a **RED** state.

3.  **(GREEN):** After a period of investigation and incorrect import attempts, the local JAX documentation was consulted. The correct function, `jax.numpy.linalg.eigh`, was identified. The `estimate_gamma` function was implemented to first construct the dense matrix representation of the linear operator and then use `eigh` to find its eigenvalues, returning the minimum. With this implementation, the test passed.

4.  **(REFACTOR):** The current implementation is correct but inefficient for large operators as it requires materializing the full matrix. This is a known performance issue. However, as a piece of the "Functional Core," it is mathematically correct and passes its contract. A future task will be created to replace this with a matrix-free Lanczos or Arnoldi iteration.

## Outcome
- We have a working, tested implementation of the `estimate_gamma` certificate.
- This is the first major component of the FDA module.
- The process highlighted the critical importance of having and consulting local, version-specific documentation, which is now a required step in our methodology.
