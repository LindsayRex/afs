# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Stochastic Primitive

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_primitives.py::test_F_Ann`

## Goal
To implement and test the final primitive, `F_Ann` (annealing/stochastic), which handles the introduction of noise via Langevin dynamics.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Added a new test, `test_F_Ann`, which attempted to import and call `F_Ann` from the `primitives.py` module. The test was designed to verify that the function correctly added noise of the appropriate variance to the state. It failed as expected with an `ImportError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Implemented the `F_Ann` function in `primitives.py`. The implementation adds scaled Gaussian noise to each variable in the state, with the scaling determined by the temperature and time step, as per the formula for Langevin dynamics. After fixing a minor typing error, the test passed.

3.  **(REFACTOR):** The code is simple and required no refactoring. This log entry completes the cycle.

## Outcome
- We have a working, tested implementation of the `F_Ann` primitive.
- **All five primitive operators (`F_Dis`, `F_Proj`, `F_Multi`, `F_Con`, `F_Ann`) are now implemented and verified.**
- This completes the foundational "Functional Core" of the runtime engine.
