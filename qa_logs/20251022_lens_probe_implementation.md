# QA Log: Lens Probe for Multiscale Transforms Implementation

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Component:** Lens Probe System  
**Goal:** Implement lens probe for multiscale transforms with compressibility metrics and automatic lens selection  

## Red Phase: Problem Analysis

### Component
Lens Probe system (`src/computable_flows_shim/multi/lens_probe.py`)

### Test
Lens probe contract tests (`tests/test_lens_probe.py`)

### Goal
Implement lens probe functionality to analyze wavelet compressibility and select optimal transforms for multiscale flows.

### Process
1. **Lens Probe Requirements**: Based on design documents, lens probe should:
   - Calculate compressibility metrics (sparsity per wavelet band)
   - Compute reconstruction error analysis
   - Run in builder mode with short-run compressibility tests
   - Record probe results in CompileReport

2. **Mathematical Foundation**:
   - Sparsity: fraction of coefficients above threshold per band
   - Reconstruction error: MSE, RMSE, relative error metrics
   - Energy distribution: fraction of total energy per decomposition band

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Compiler integration for automatic lens selection
   - CompileReport extension with probe results
   - Builder mode execution during compilation

### Outcome
- Identified core functions: `calculate_compressibility`, `calculate_reconstruction_error`, `run_lens_probe`
- Established contract tests for mathematical properties
- Determined integration with energy compiler

## Green Phase: Implementation

### Component
Complete lens probe system with compiler integration

### Test
All contract tests passing, compiler integration working

### Goal
Implement lens probe with full functionality and integration

### Process
1. **Core Lens Probe Functions**:
   - `calculate_compressibility`: Computes sparsity per band, energy distribution, overall sparsity
   - `calculate_reconstruction_error`: MSE, RMSE, relative error, max error metrics
   - `run_lens_probe`: Orchestrates probe execution with candidate evaluation and selection

2. **Builder Mode Integration**:
   - `_run_lens_probe_if_needed`: Triggers probe for wavelet_l1 terms
   - `_generate_sample_data_for_lens_probe`: Creates reproducible test data
   - `_create_compile_report`: Integrates probe results into CompileReport

3. **Selection Rules**:
   - `min_reconstruction_error`: Selects lens with best reconstruction quality
   - `max_sparsity_at_target`: Selects lens with highest sparsity at target level

### Key Code Changes

**lens_probe.py:**
```python
def calculate_compressibility(coeffs, threshold=1e-8):
    # Calculate sparsity metrics per band and overall
    # Returns: overall_sparsity, band_sparsity, energy_distribution

def calculate_reconstruction_error(original, reconstruction):
    # Compute error metrics: mse, rmse, relative_error, max_error
    # Returns comprehensive error analysis

def run_lens_probe(data, candidates, target_sparsity=0.8, selection_rule='min_reconstruction_error'):
    # Run full probe: evaluate candidates, select best lens
    # Returns probe results with selection and metrics
```

**compile.py:**
```python
def _run_lens_probe_if_needed(spec):
    # Trigger lens probe for multiscale terms
    # Generate sample data and run evaluation

def _create_compile_report(spec, lens_probe_results):
    # Integrate probe results into CompileReport
    # Record selected lens and probe metadata
```

### Outcome
- All contract tests passing (9/9)
- Compressibility metrics working correctly
- Reconstruction error analysis accurate
- Compiler integration complete with automatic probe execution
- Lens selection based on mathematical criteria

## Refactor Phase: Code Quality

### Component
Lens probe implementation with quality assurance

### Test
Pylint 10.00/10, all existing tests still pass

### Goal
Ensure code quality meets standards while maintaining functionality

### Process
1. **Pylint Fixes**:
   - Fixed import style (`from jax import random`)
   - Removed unused variables
   - Fixed control flow (removed unnecessary elif)
   - Added missing final newline

2. **Type Safety**: Ensured proper return types and error handling

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing compiler behavior for non-multiscale specs

### Code Quality Metrics
- **lens_probe.py**: 9.12/10 â†’ 10.00/10 pylint score (after fixes)
- **compile.py**: 10.00/10 pylint score maintained
- **test_lens_probe.py**: All tests passing
- **All tests**: 190/190 passing (no regressions)

### Outcome
- Code quality standards met across all modified files
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Clean, maintainable implementation following DbC principles

## Summary

Successfully implemented lens probe system for multiscale transforms with comprehensive compressibility analysis and automatic lens selection. The implementation follows TDD principles with thorough contract testing and achieves perfect code quality scores.

**Key Achievements:**
- Compressibility metrics per wavelet band with energy distribution analysis
- Reconstruction error analysis with multiple quality metrics
- Builder mode integration with automatic probe execution during compilation
- Lens selection based on mathematical criteria (reconstruction error, sparsity)
- CompileReport integration with probe results and metadata
- Full test coverage with 9 contract tests verifying mathematical properties

**Impact:** 
Multiscale flows now benefit from automatic lens selection based on compressibility analysis, enabling optimal wavelet transform choice for each problem. The lens probe provides data-driven transform selection rather than manual configuration, improving both performance and ease of use.

**Integration:**
- Seamlessly integrated into energy compiler
- Automatic execution for specs with wavelet_l1 terms
- Results recorded in CompileReport for telemetry and reproducibility
- Backward compatible with existing non-multiscale flows

**Quality Assurance:**
- 190/190 tests passing
- 10.00/10 pylint scores
- Contract tests verify mathematical correctness
- No regressions in existing functionality
