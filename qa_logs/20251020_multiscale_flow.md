# QA Log: Multiscale Flow Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-20

**Author:** GitHub Copilot

**Goal:** To implement the full multiscale flow in run_flow_step, enabling wavelet-based representation and sparsity metrics for tuning.

## TDD Cycle

### Red: Initial State Analysis

- **Problem:** The runtime flow was simplified to F_Dis → F_Proj without multiscale transforms. This prevented wavelet decomposition and sparsity-based tuning.
- **Test:** A failing test `test_run_flow_step_multiscale` was written to verify multiscale step execution with identity transform.

### Green: Implementation Changes

- **Multiscale Flow:** Updated `run_flow_step` in both `engine.py` and `step.py` to optionally include F_Multi_forward and F_Multi_inverse when W (transform) is provided.
- **Flow Logic:** F_Dis operates in physical domain, then transforms to W-space for F_Proj, then back to physical domain.
- **Type Hints:** Fixed JAX type annotations to use `jnp.ndarray` directly.
- **Test Addition:** Added test for multiscale step with identity transform to verify the flow works.
- **Telemetry Placeholder:** Added `sparsity_wx` field to controller logging (placeholder value 0.0 until W-space computation is integrated).

### Refactor: Code Cleanup and Finalization

- Ensured Functional Core/Imperative Shell separation: multiscale logic is pure, telemetry is side effect.
- Aligned with design in `02_primitives_operator_api.md` and `07_runtime_engine.md`.
- Maintained TDD: test defines multiscale contract.

## Outcome

The runtime now supports full multiscale flow (F_Dis → F_Multi+ → F_Proj → F_Multi-), enabling wavelet-based optimization. Sparsity telemetry placeholder is added for future W-space metrics. This provides the foundation for advanced tuning based on multiscale representations. Next steps include integrating real wavelet transforms and computing sparsity metrics in W-space.</content>
