# QA Log: 2025-10-22 - Manifold Adapters Implementation

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/manifolds.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_manifold_adapters.py`

## Goal
To implement comprehensive manifold adapters for Riemannian optimization, providing geometric primitives (Euclidean, Sphere, Stiefel, PositiveDefinite manifolds) with tangent space projections, retractions, and Riemannian gradients to enable physics-first computational flows on non-Euclidean state spaces.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1. **(RED):** Created comprehensive contract tests in `test_manifold_adapters.py` that defined the desired geometric properties:
   - Tangent space orthogonality (projections perpendicular to normal vectors)
   - Sphere constraint preservation (unit norm maintained)
   - Stiefel orthogonality (orthogonal matrices preserved)
   - Riemannian gradient correctness (tangent space projections)
   - Retraction properties (manifold constraint satisfaction)
   - F_Dis integration with manifold dictionaries
   - Numerical precision and stability

   All tests initially failed as expected since manifold adapters were not yet implemented.

2. **(GREEN):** Implemented the complete manifold adapter system:
   - `ManifoldAdapter` abstract base class with standard interface
   - `EuclideanManifold` for flat space optimization (identity operations)
   - `SphereManifold` for unit sphere constraints with tangent projections
   - `StiefelManifold` for orthogonal matrices with QR-based retractions
   - `PositiveDefiniteManifold` for SPD matrices with matrix exponential retractions
   - Factory pattern with `create_manifold()` and `MANIFOLD_REGISTRY`
   - Riemannian gradient methods for each manifold type

   Updated `F_Dis` primitive in `primitives.py` to accept manifold dictionaries and perform Riemannian gradient descent steps.

3. **(REFACTOR):** Fixed numerical precision issues in tests by adjusting tolerances from 1e-10 to 1e-6 for JAX floating-point stability, and corrected the F_Dis integration test to use a function with non-zero Riemannian gradient on the sphere manifold (avoiding the constant function pitfall).

## Outcome
- ✅ Complete manifold adapter system with 4 geometric primitives implemented
- ✅ All 11 contract tests pass, enforcing geometric correctness and numerical stability
- ✅ F_Dis primitive supports both Euclidean and Riemannian optimization
- ✅ Tangent space projections maintain manifold constraints
- ✅ Riemannian gradients computed correctly for each manifold type
- ✅ Factory pattern enables easy manifold instantiation and extension
- ✅ JAX-compatible operations with proper JIT and gradient support
- ✅ Ready for integration with multiscale flows and controller phases

The manifold adapters foundation is complete and geometrically verified, enabling Riemannian optimization flows on curved state spaces while maintaining the established TDD/DbC methodology with comprehensive contract testing.
