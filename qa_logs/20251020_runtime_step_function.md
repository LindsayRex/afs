# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Runtime Step Function

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/step.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_runtime.py::test_forward_backward_step`

## Goal
To implement the `run_flow_step` function, which orchestrates the primitive operators to execute one full step of a flow algorithm. This is the next layer of the "Functional Core," composing the individual primitives into a useful computation.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Created a new test file, `tests/test_runtime.py`, with a single test, `test_forward_backward_step`. This test defined a composite energy function (quadratic + L1) and attempted to call the non-existent `run_flow_step` function. The test failed as expected with a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Created `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/step.py` and implemented the `run_flow_step` function. The implementation correctly composes the `F_Dis` and `F_Proj` primitives to execute one step of the Forward-Backward Splitting algorithm. After fixing a minor typing error, the test passed.

3.  **(REFACTOR):** The code is simple and required no refactoring. This log entry completes the cycle.

## Outcome
- We have a working, tested implementation of the `run_flow_step` function.
- We have successfully demonstrated the composition of our primitives (`F_Dis` and `F_Proj`) and our compiler to execute a complete, meaningful algorithm step.
- This completes another "vertical slice" of the core engine, showing how the components work together.
