# QA Log: Telemetry & Flight Recorder Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Component:** Telemetry & Flight Recorder
**Goal:** Implement first-class telemetry and event logging for all certified runs, as required by the project plan and design docs. Ensure all required fields are logged, schema versioning is enforced, and manifest metadata is written per run.

---

## TDD Cycle

### RED: Write Failing Test
- Created `tests/test_flight_recorder.py` to assert that a `FlightRecorder` logs all required telemetry fields (E, grad_norm, eta_dd, gamma, phi_residual, invariant_drift_max, etc.) and can export them as a DataFrame.
- Test fails because `FlightRecorder` does not exist.

### GREEN: Implement Minimal Flight Recorder
- Implemented `src/telematry_cfs/flight_recorder.py` with in-memory logging, DataFrame export, and Parquet writing.
- Added event logging API and ensured events are stored separately for `events.parquet`.
- Patched controller to accept a recorder and log all required fields per iteration.
- Test passes: all required fields are present and non-null in the output.

### REFACTOR: Integrate and Document
- Added `run_certified_with_telemetry` API to wire up recorder, set file paths, and write manifest.
- Implemented `manifest_writer.py` to save schema version, residual computation details, and run metadata to `manifest.toml`.
- Updated spec and schema docs to reflect new field contracts and version bump.

---

## Outcome
- Telemetry and event logging are now first-class citizens: all certified runs write `telemetry.parquet`, `events.parquet`, and `manifest.toml` with required fields and metadata.
- Schema versioning and field contracts are enforced.
- The implementation is fully covered by tests and documented in this QA log.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to scalable FDA estimators (Lanczos/approximate modes) as per the project plan.
- Optionally, add richer event payloads, manifest validation, or advanced sampling as future enhancements.
