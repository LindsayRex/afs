# QA Log: FDA Certificates Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-20

**Author:** GitHub Copilot

**Goal:** To integrate Flow Dynamic Analysis (FDA) certificate checks into the runtime engine, enabling validation of flow stability and convergence before execution.

## TDD Cycle

### Red: Initial State Analysis

- **Problem:** The runtime engine lacked FDA certificate validation. While the FDA certificates (eta_dd, gamma) were implemented, they were not integrated into the flow execution to enforce mathematical guarantees.
- **Test:** A failing integration test was written to verify that certificate checks are performed and logged as events during flow execution.

### Green: Implementation Changes

- **FDA Integration:** Imported `estimate_eta_dd` and `estimate_gamma` from the FDA module into the runtime engine.
- **Certificate Computation:** Added certificate estimation at the start of `run_flow`, computing eta_dd and gamma using the compiled energy's L_apply operator.
- **Event Logging:** Logged the certificate results as a "CERT_CHECK" event in the telemetry events parquet file.
- **Test Update:** Enhanced the integration test to verify the presence of the CERT_CHECK event with eta_dd and gamma values.

### Refactor: Code Cleanup and Finalization

- Ensured the integration follows the Functional Core/Imperative Shell pattern: certificate computation is pure (core), logging is side effect (shell).
- Aligned with design specifications in `05_fda_certificates.md` and `07_runtime_engine.md`.
- Maintained TDD: tests define the contract for certificate logging.

## Outcome

FDA certificate checks are now integrated into the runtime engine. Flows compute and log eta_dd (diagonal dominance) and gamma (spectral gap) at startup, providing the foundation for controller phases (RED/AMBER/GREEN) and gating unstable runs. The integration test confirms proper event logging. This enables the next phase of implementing the controller automaton for certificate-based flow management.</content>
