# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Dissipative Primitive for Quadratic Atom

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_primitives.py::test_F_Dis_quadratic`

## Goal
To implement and test the `F_Dis` (dissipative) primitive, demonstrating that it can correctly use a compiled energy function's gradient to update a system's state.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Created `tests/test_primitives.py` with a new test, `test_F_Dis_quadratic`. This test performed the full end-to-end process for a quadratic atom:
    *   Defined the spec.
    *   Called `compile_energy` to get the energy function.
    *   Used `jax.grad` to get the gradient function.
    *   Attempted to call `F_Dis` from the non-existent `primitives.py` file.
    The test failed as expected with a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Created `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py` and implemented the `F_Dis` function according to the design specification. The implementation performs a simple gradient descent step. The test then passed, confirming the implementation was correct.

3.  **(REFACTOR):** The code is simple and required no refactoring. This log entry completes the cycle.

## Outcome
- We have a working, tested implementation of the `F_Dis` primitive.
- We have successfully demonstrated the first end-to-end "vertical slice" of the system:
  **Spec -> Compiler -> Gradient -> Primitive -> Verified State Update**
- This confirms that our "Functional Core" components are composing correctly.
