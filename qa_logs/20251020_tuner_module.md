# QA Log: Tuner Module Implementation

## Date: 20251020

## Summary
Implemented the tuner module for cross-run parameter optimization, providing proactive auto-tuning that learns from historical telemetry data to suggest improved parameters for future flow executions.

## TDD Cycle

### RED Phase: Define Contract
- **Test**: `test_tuner_suggests_lower_alpha_on_high_remediation`
- **Contract**: Given historical runs with high remediation at α=0.1, tuner should suggest lower α to reduce future remediations.
- **Failure**: ImportError - `computable_flows_shim.tuner` module not found.

### GREEN Phase: Implement Minimal Solution
- **Changes**:
  - Created `src/computable_flows_shim/tuner.py` with `suggest_parameters()` function
  - Implemented basic logic: group runs by α, find α with lowest average remediations
  - If best α still has >2 average remediations, reduce by 30%
  - Clamp results to reasonable bounds (0.001 < α < 1.0)
- **Test Passes**: All assertions satisfied with suggested α < 0.1.

### REFACTOR Phase: Clean and Extend
- **Improvements**:
  - Used `statistics.mean()` for cleaner averaging
  - Enhanced docstring with formal contract specification
  - Added edge case handling for empty history
  - Added test for best α selection from multiple options
- **Additional Tests**:
  - `test_tuner_handles_empty_history`: Verifies default fallback
  - `test_tuner_suggests_best_alpha_from_history`: Ensures optimal selection

## Key Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm
```python
def suggest_parameters(history: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # Group by alpha, compute average remediations
    alpha_stats = {}
    for run in history:
        alpha = run.get('alpha', 0.1)
        rems = run.get('num_remediations', 0)
        alpha_stats.setdefault(alpha, []).append(rems)

    # Find alpha with lowest average remediations
    best_alpha = min(alpha_stats.keys(), key=lambda a: mean(alpha_stats[a]))

    # Conservative reduction if still high remediations
    avg_rems = mean(alpha_stats[best_alpha])
    suggested_alpha = best_alpha * 0.7 if avg_rems > 2.0 else best_alpha

    return {'alpha': max(0.001, min(1.0, suggested_alpha))}
```

### Design by Contract Compliance
- **Preconditions**: History contains dicts with 'alpha' and 'num_remediations' keys
- **Postconditions**: Returns dict with 'alpha' key containing suggested value
- **Invariants**: Suggested α is bounded (0.001 ≤ α ≤ 1.0) to prevent instability

### Functional Core Pattern
- Pure function with no side effects
- Deterministic output based on input history
- Easy to test and compose

## Test Coverage
- ✅ `test_tuner_suggests_lower_alpha_on_high_remediation`: Core remediation reduction logic
- ✅ `test_tuner_handles_empty_history`: Edge case handling
- ✅ `test_tuner_suggests_best_alpha_from_history`: Optimal selection verification

## Integration Points
- **Input**: Telemetry data from flight recorder (future integration)
- **Output**: Parameter suggestions for `run_certified()` or similar
- **Usage**: Call before flow execution to get smarter initial parameters

## Performance Characteristics
- O(N) time complexity where N is number of historical runs
- Minimal memory usage (groups runs by α)
- Suitable for real-time parameter suggestion

## Future Extensions
- Multi-parameter optimization (weights, tolerances)
- Bayesian optimization for exploration-exploitation balance
- Integration with telemetry storage (Parquet/DuckDB)
- Confidence intervals for suggestions
- A/B testing framework for parameter validation

## Verification
- All tests pass (3/3)
- TDD methodology followed: Test → Implement → Refactor
- Contract violations properly handled with bounds checking
- Functional core maintains purity and testability
