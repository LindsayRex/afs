# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Dissipative Primitive (Verification)

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_primitives.py::test_F_Dis_quadratic`

## Goal
To implement and test the `F_Dis` (dissipative) primitive according to the TDD cycle.

## Process Anomaly
The standard Red-Green-Refactor cycle was not followed correctly due to a procedural error.

1.  **(RED):** A failing test, `test_F_Dis_quadratic`, was created in a new `tests/test_primitives.py` file. The test was intended to fail due to the non-existence of the `primitives.py` module.

2.  **(UNEXPECTED GREEN):** The test **passed** on the first run.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py` file, containing a correct implementation of `F_Dis`, already existed from a previous, aborted development session. The "clean slate" was not clean.

## Outcome
- Despite the procedural failure, we have a working, tested implementation of the `F_Dis` primitive.
- We have successfully verified the end-to-end "vertical slice" of the system:
  **Spec -> Compiler -> Gradient -> Primitive -> Verified State Update**
- This confirms that our "Functional Core" components are composing correctly.
- **Corrective Action:** Future TDD cycles must begin with an explicit check to ensure the target module does not already exist.
