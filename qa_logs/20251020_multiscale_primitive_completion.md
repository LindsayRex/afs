# 20251020 - Multiscale Primitive (F_Multi) Implementation Completion

## Summary
Successfully implemented the F_Multi primitive as the critical missing component for AFS wavelet-based optimization. This completes the core multiscale transform functionality enabling differentiable wavelet transforms in the optimization flow.

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ F_Multi Primitive Implementation
- **Core Function**: F_Multi now properly delegates to transform objects with `forward(x)` and `inverse(x)` methods
- **Wavelet Integration**: Uses jaxwt's 1D wavelet transforms appropriate for AFS parameter vectors
- **Differentiability**: All operations are differentiable since jaxwt is JAX-based
- **API Consistency**: Updated all imports/calls throughout codebase to use unified F_Multi API

### ✅ Documentation Review Insights
**JAX Fundamentals:**
- Automatic differentiation with `jax.grad`, `jax.value_and_grad`
- Immutable arrays, functional programming paradigm
- PyTree abstraction for nested data structures
- JIT compilation for performance

**jaxwt (JAX Wavelet Toolbox):**
- Differentiable GPU-enabled wavelet transforms
- `wavedec`/`waverec` for 1D signals (returns list of coefficient arrays)
- `wavedec2`/`waverec2` for 2D signals
- 100% PyWavelets compatible but with gradient support
- Works on batched data

### ✅ Test Coverage
- Comprehensive tests including wavelet roundtrip verification
- Type safety with proper Protocol definitions
- All 31 tests passing
- Pylance type errors resolved

### ✅ Code Quality
- Proper type annotations with TransformProtocol
- Clean API design with unified forward/inverse interface
- Full integration with existing AFS flow architecture

## Technical Details

### F_Multi Function Signature
```python
def F_Multi(x: Union[Array, List[Array]], W: TransformProtocol, direction: str) -> Union[Array, List[Array]]
```

### Transform Protocol
```python
class TransformProtocol(Protocol):
    def forward(self, x: Array) -> List[Array]: ...
    def inverse(self, x: List[Array]) -> Array: ...
```

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 31
- **Passed**: 31
- **Failed**: 0
- **Coverage**: All primitive operations verified

## Impact
The F_Multi primitive is now the fully functional multiscale transform component that enables wavelet-based optimization in AFS. This was identified as the most critical missing piece for the multiscale flow implementation.

## Next Steps
With F_Multi complete, the AFS system now has all core primitives (F_Dis, F_Proj, F_Multi, F_Con, F_Ann) implemented and ready for integration into the full optimization pipeline.</content>
