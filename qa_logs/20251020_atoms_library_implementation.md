# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Atoms Library Implementation

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/atoms/`
**Test:** `tests/test_atoms.py`

## Goal
To implement the fundamental **Atoms Library** as the mathematical foundation for AFS, providing composable building blocks for energy functionals. Each atom must implement the four core operations (energy, gradient, prox, certificates) with mathematical rigor, following TDD methodology and Design by Contract principles.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

### Phase 1: QuadraticAtom Implementation

#### Cycle 1: Create Atom Base Class and Registry
1. **(RED):** Created comprehensive test suite `tests/test_atoms.py` with `TestQuadraticAtomContract` class. Tests defined mathematical contracts for energy computation, gradient, proximal operator, and certificate contributions. All tests failed as expected with `ModuleNotFoundError` for non-existent atoms module.

2. **(GREEN):** 
   - Created `src/computable_flows_shim/atoms/library.py` with abstract `Atom` base class
   - Implemented `QuadraticAtom` with all four required methods
   - Created `ATOM_REGISTRY` and `create_atom()` factory function
   - Added proper imports in `__init__.py`
   - Fixed Python path in `pyproject.toml` to include `src/`
   - All 7 QuadraticAtom tests passed

3. **(REFACTOR):** Enhanced documentation, improved type hints, and added mathematical comments to prox method explaining the linear system solution.

#### Cycle 2: TikhonovAtom Implementation
1. **(RED):** Added `TestTikhonovAtomContract` class with 7 tests covering regularized least squares. Tests enforced contracts for energy with regularization term, modified gradient, regularized proximal operator, and improved certificate contributions. Tests failed initially due to missing implementation.

2. **(GREEN):**
   - Implemented `TikhonovAtom` class with Œª‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÇ¬≤ regularization
   - Added to `ATOM_REGISTRY` 
   - Updated exports in `__init__.py`
   - All 7 TikhonovAtom tests passed, including verification of improved conditioning

3. **(REFACTOR):** Refined certificate contribution logic to properly reflect regularization benefits vs. increased Lipschitz constants.

#### Cycle 3: L1Atom Implementation  
1. **(RED):** Added `TestL1AtomContract` class with 7 tests for sparse regularization. Tests covered L1 energy computation, subgradient (sign function), soft-thresholding proximal operator, sparsity promotion, and nonsmooth certificate contributions. Tests failed due to missing L1Atom implementation.

2. **(GREEN):**
   - Implemented `L1Atom` class with Œª‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ regularization
   - Implemented soft-thresholding proximal operator: `S_ŒªœÑ(x) = sign(x) * max(|x| - ŒªœÑ, 0)`
   - Added to `ATOM_REGISTRY` and exports
   - All 7 L1Atom tests passed, including sparsity verification

3. **(REFACTOR):** Enhanced factory function with better error messages and available atom type listing.

### Phase 2: Integration and Verification

#### Cycle 4: Cross-Atom Integration Testing
1. **(RED):** Added factory function tests to ensure all three atoms can be created correctly. Tests verified error handling for unknown atom types.

2. **(GREEN):** All factory tests passed. Registry correctly handles all three atom types.

3. **(REFACTOR):** Improved error messages in `create_atom()` to show available atom types.

#### Cycle 5: Full Test Suite Validation
1. **(RED):** Ran complete test suite to ensure no regressions between atoms.

2. **(GREEN):** All 21 tests passed across all three atom implementations.

3. **(REFACTOR):** Minor documentation improvements and consistent code formatting.

## Mathematical Contracts Verified

### QuadraticAtom: `(1/2)‚ÄñAx - b‚Äñ¬≤`
- **Energy:** Correct quadratic form computation
- **Gradient:** `A^T(Ax - b)` with numerical precision
- **Prox:** Exact solution via regularized linear system
- **Certificates:** Spectral norm Lipschitz bounds

### TikhonovAtom: `(1/2)‚ÄñAx - b‚Äñ¬≤ + (Œª/2)‚Äñx‚Äñ¬≤`
- **Energy:** Combined data fidelity + regularization
- **Gradient:** `A^T(Ax - b) + Œªx` 
- **Prox:** Regularized system `(A^T A + ŒªI + I/œÑ) x = A^T b + x/œÑ`
- **Certificates:** Improved conditioning with regularization benefits

### L1Atom: `Œª‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ`
- **Energy:** L1 norm computation
- **Subgradient:** `Œª*sign(x)` (nonsmooth)
- **Prox:** Soft-thresholding operator promoting sparsity
- **Certificates:** Zero contributions (nonsmooth regularization)

## Test Coverage Metrics
