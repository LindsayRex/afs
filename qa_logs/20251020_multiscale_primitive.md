# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Multiscale Primitive

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/runtime/primitives.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_primitives.py::test_F_Multi`

## Goal
To implement and test the `F_Multi` (multiscale) primitive, which handles forward and inverse transforms (e.g., wavelets).

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Added a new test, `test_F_Multi`, which attempted to import and call `F_Multi_forward` and `F_Multi_inverse` from the `primitives.py` module. The test failed as expected with an `ImportError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Implemented the `F_Multi_forward` and `F_Multi_inverse` functions in `primitives.py`. These functions are simple wrappers that call the `.forward()` and `.inverse()` methods of a given transform object. The test then passed.

3.  **(REFACTOR):** The code is simple and required no refactoring. This log entry completes the cycle.

## Outcome
- We have a working, tested implementation of the `F_Multi` primitive.
- The core set of deterministic primitives is now nearly complete.
