# QA Log: Flow Selector Implementation for AFS Dashboard

## Overview
Implemented a flow selector dropdown in the AFS Flow Dynamics HUD to allow users to switch between different optimization flows by name. This enables monitoring multiple flows from the same interface, supporting the telemetry architecture where flows are identified by business intent names from the Python DSL framework.

## Requirements Analysis
- **User Need**: Ability to select and monitor different flows by name
- **Technical Context**: Flows identified by `flow_name` in telemetry, names come from business intent documents
- **UI Requirements**: Always visible selector (menu/dropdown), updates dashboard display when changed
- **Integration**: Should work with existing telemetry system and flow naming conventions

## Implementation Details

### Flow Selector UI
- **Location**: Fixed position in top-left corner for constant visibility
- **Component**: HTML select dropdown with flow names as options
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing dashboard theme (dark background, rounded corners)

### Flow Data Structure
```javascript
const flows = {
    'flow_name': {
        name: 'flow_name',
        sparsity: 0.12,
        health: 'GREEN',
        detailLevel: 'Level 4/6',
        view: 'db4 wavelet',
        activeTerms: 4,
        description: 'Human-readable description'
    }
}
```

### Sample Flows Added
- `deconv_wavelet_v1`: Deconvolution with wavelet regularization (sparsity: 0.12, GREEN)
- `sparse_reconstruction`: Sparse signal reconstruction (sparsity: 0.08, GREEN)
- `multiscale_denoising`: Multiscale denoising flow (sparsity: 0.25, AMBER)
- `flow_test_sweep_001`: Test sweep for parameter optimization (sparsity: 0.35, RED)
- `wavelet_compression_v2`: Advanced wavelet compression v2 (sparsity: 0.05, GREEN)

### Dynamic Updates
- **Flow Selection**: Triggers `updateFlowDisplay()` function
- **Dashboard Updates**:
  - Current flow name in header
  - Sparsity value and visualization
  - Health status and indicator
  - Complexity metrics (active terms, detail level, view)
  - Control slider position
  - Event ticker with flow change notification
  - Timeline reset for new flow

### Event System Integration
- **Flow Change Events**: Added to event ticker with gold highlighting
- **Animation**: Smooth slide-in animation for flow change notifications
- **Persistence**: Current flow state maintained during session

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
1. **Flow Selection**: Verified dropdown shows all flow options
2. **State Updates**: Confirmed all dashboard elements update correctly when flow changes
3. **Visual Feedback**: Checked animations and color changes work properly
4. **Event Logging**: Verified flow change events appear in ticker
5. **Persistence**: Confirmed flow state maintains during interactions

### Integration Testing
1. **Web Server**: HTTP server starts without errors
2. **File Loading**: Dashboard loads correctly at `http://localhost:8000/sparsity_hud_demo.html`
3. **Anime.js**: Animation library loads and functions properly
4. **No Console Errors**: Browser developer tools show no JavaScript errors

### Edge Cases Tested
- **Rapid Switching**: Switching between flows quickly doesn't break animations
- **Extreme Values**: Flows with very low/high sparsity values display correctly
- **Event Overflow**: Event ticker handles multiple flow changes gracefully

## Code Quality

### Structure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Flow data separate from display logic
- **Modularity**: `updateFlowDisplay()` function handles all state updates
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new flows to the `flows` object

### Performance
- **Efficient Updates**: Only updates changed elements, not full re-render
- **Animation Optimization**: Uses anime.js for smooth, performant animations
- **Memory Management**: Event listeners properly attached, no memory leaks

### Maintainability
- **Clear Naming**: Functions and variables have descriptive names
- **Documentation**: Inline comments explain complex logic
- **Consistent Style**: Follows existing codebase patterns

## Future Integration Points

### Telemetry Integration
- **Dynamic Loading**: Replace static `flows` object with API calls to telemetry system
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to telemetry streams for live flow data
- **Flow Discovery**: Automatically populate dropdown from available telemetry data

### Enhanced Features
- **Flow Creation**: Add "New Flow" option to create flows from templates
- **Flow Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple flows
- **Flow History**: Show historical performance of selected flow
- **Flow Templates**: Predefined flow configurations for common use cases

## Files Modified
- `src/ux/sparsity_hud_demo.html`: Added flow selector UI and logic

## Files Created
- `qa_logs/20251020_flow_selector_implementation.md`: This QA log

## Validation Results
- ✅ Flow selector appears and functions correctly
- ✅ Dashboard updates properly when flows are switched
- ✅ Animations and visual feedback work as expected
- ✅ No JavaScript errors or console warnings
- ✅ Web server serves dashboard without issues
- ✅ Event system properly logs flow changes

## Conclusion
The flow selector implementation successfully enables users to switch between different optimization flows in the AFS dashboard. The feature integrates cleanly with the existing telemetry architecture and provides clear visual feedback for flow changes. The implementation is extensible for future enhancements like dynamic flow loading and real-time telemetry integration.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate with actual telemetry system to load flows dynamically
2. Add flow creation and management capabilities
3. Implement flow comparison features
4. Add flow performance history visualization
