# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Quadratic Atom Compiler

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/energy/compile.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_compiler.py::test_compile_quadratic_term`

## Goal
To implement the energy compiler for the simplest smooth term, the "Quadratic Atom," following our TDD and "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" methodology.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

### Cycle 1: Create the Compiler Module

1.  **(RED):** Added a new test, `test_compile_quadratic_term`, which attempted to import `compile_energy` from a non-existent `compile.py` file. The test failed as expected with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Created `src/computable_flows_shim/energy/compile.py` with a placeholder `compile_energy` function that returned a simple callable. The test passed.

### Cycle 2: Implement the Quadratic Logic

1.  **(RED):** Modified `test_compile_quadratic_term` to call the compiled function and assert that it returned the correct energy value for a sample input (`0.5`). The test failed because the placeholder returned `0.0`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Implemented the logic within `compile_energy` to handle terms of `type='quadratic'`. After fixing some minor import and typing errors, the test passed.

### Cycle 3: Refactor

1.  **(REFACTOR):** The code was working, but the structure could be improved.
    *   Created `src/computable_flows_shim/api.py`.
    *   Moved the `Op` protocol from `specs.py` to `api.py` to better separate the API from the data structures.
    *   Cleaned up the test file to import from the new `api.py` and improve the definition of the test operator.

2.  **(VERIFY):** Reran all tests to ensure they remained **GREEN** after refactoring.

## Outcome
- The energy compiler now correctly handles the **Quadratic Atom**.
- We have a working, tested component of our "Functional Core" that can translate a piece of the specification into an executable JAX function.
- The project structure is cleaner, with a dedicated `api.py` file.
- The TDD workflow is proving effective at building the system incrementally and verifiably.
