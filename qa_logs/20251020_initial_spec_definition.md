# QA Log: 2025-10-20 - Initial Spec Definition

**Component:** `src/computable_flows_shim/energy/specs.py`
**Test:** `tests/test_compiler.py::test_spec_creation`

## Goal
To define the core data structures for the energy specification, following a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) and "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" methodology.

## Process (Red-Green-Refactor)

1.  **(RED):** Created `tests/test_compiler.py` with a single test, `test_spec_creation`. The test attempted to import and instantiate `EnergySpec` from a non-existent `specs.py` file. This correctly failed with a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

2.  **(GREEN):** Created `src/computable_flows_shim/energy/specs.py` and implemented the `EnergySpec`, `TermSpec`, and `StateSpec` dataclasses. After fixing a minor import error in the new file, the test passed.

3.  **(REFACTOR):** The code is simple and required no refactoring. This log entry completes the cycle.

## Outcome
- The foundational data structures for the energy specification are now defined and located correctly according to the `11_naming_and_layout.md` design document.
- The TDD process was successfully initiated, confirming our ability to write a failing test and then write the code to make it pass.
- We have a small, verified component of our "Functional Core."
