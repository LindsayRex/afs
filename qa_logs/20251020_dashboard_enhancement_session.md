# QA Log: AFS Dashboard Enhancement Session - Sparsity Visualization & Flow Selection

## Session Overview
Comprehensive enhancement of the AFS Flow Dynamics HUD with advanced sparsity visualization features and flow selection capabilities. This session focused on creating an interactive dashboard for monitoring optimization flows with real-time sparsity metrics, particle effects, and multi-flow support.

## Objectives Achieved
1. **Enhanced Sparsity Visualization**: Advanced dashboard with particle effects, timeline progress, and interactive controls
2. **Flow Selection System**: Dropdown selector for switching between different optimization flows by name
3. **Real-time Animations**: Smooth transitions, compression wave effects, and sound feedback
4. **Multi-flow Monitoring**: Support for comparative analysis across different flows
5. **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive README and UX documentation updates

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Sparsity Computation Integration
- **Location**: `src/computable_flows_shim/controller.py`
- **Feature**: Implemented actual sparsity computation using L1/L2 ratio from W-space
- **Formula**: `sparsity = ||W||‚ÇÅ / (||W||‚ÇÇ * ‚àön)`
- **Integration**: Added to controller telemetry logging system
- **Validation**: Verified computation matches FDA sparsity principles

### 2. Advanced Dashboard Features
- **File**: `src/ux/sparsity_hud_demo.html`
- **Particle System**: Energy particles for sparse solutions (< 0.2 sparsity)
- **Timeline Progress**: Visual progress bar with smooth animations
- **Compression Waves**: Radial wave effects for sparsity changes
- **Theme Toggle**: Dark/light mode switching
- **Sound Effects**: Web Audio API procedural sounds for events
- **Simulation Mode**: Full optimization run simulation with realistic sparsity evolution

### 3. Flow Selection System
- **UI Component**: Fixed dropdown selector in top-left corner
- **Flow Library**: 5 sample flows with realistic configurations:
  - `deconv_wavelet_v1`: Deconvolution with wavelet regularization
  - `sparse_reconstruction`: Sparse signal reconstruction
  - `multiscale_denoising`: Multiscale denoising flow
  - `flow_test_sweep_001`: Test sweep for parameter optimization
  - `wavelet_compression_v2`: Advanced wavelet compression v2
- **Dynamic Updates**: Complete dashboard state refresh on flow selection
- **Event Logging**: Flow changes logged in event ticker with animations

### 4. Animation System
- **Library**: anime.js v3.2.1 for high-performance animations
- **Effects**:
  - Color morphing based on sparsity levels (blue ‚Üí green ‚Üí red)
  - Elastic settling for stability changes
  - Compression wave propagation
  - Particle system with opacity/scale animations
  - Smooth timeline progress updates
- **Performance**: Optimized for 60fps animations

### 5. Audio System
- **Web Audio API**: Procedural sound generation
- **Effects**: Frequency sweep (800Hz ‚Üí 400Hz) for compression events
- **Controls**: Optional sound toggle (üîä/üîá)
- **Integration**: Tied to sparsity change events

## Code Quality & Architecture

### Functional Core, Imperative Shell Pattern
- **Pure Functions**: Sparsity computation and flow data structures
- **Side Effects**: UI updates, animations, and audio isolated
- **Testability**: Dashboard logic separated from rendering

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Updates**: Targeted DOM updates instead of full re-renders
- **Animation Batching**: Coordinated multi-element animations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of particles and event listeners
- **Lazy Loading**: Audio context created only when needed

### Extensibility Design
- **Flow Data Structure**: Easy to extend with new flow configurations
- **Modular Components**: Dashboard sections can be independently enhanced
- **API Ready**: Structured for real telemetry integration
- **Configuration**: Centralized flow definitions for easy maintenance

## Testing & Validation

1. **Flow Selection**: Verified dropdown functionality and state updates
2. **Animation Effects**: Tested particle system, compression waves, and transitions
3. **Audio System**: Confirmed sound effects work and can be disabled
4. **Theme Switching**: Validated dark/light mode transitions
5. **Simulation Mode**: Tested full optimization run with realistic sparsity evolution
6. **Cross-browser**: Verified functionality in modern browsers

### Integration Testing
1. **Web Server**: HTTP server serves dashboard correctly (200 status)
2. **Dependencies**: anime.js loads and functions properly
3. **File Structure**: All assets accessible via HTTP
4. **No Console Errors**: Clean browser developer tools output

### Performance Testing
1. **Animation Frame Rate**: Maintained 60fps during complex animations
2. **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks detected during extended use
3. **Load Times**: Dashboard loads quickly with local server
4. **Responsiveness**: UI remains responsive during heavy animations
